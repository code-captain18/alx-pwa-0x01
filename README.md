X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
X-RapidAPI-Host: moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com

### Example Response
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "tt1375666",
      "titleText": {
        "text": "Inception"

    }
  ]
}

## Authentication

To access the MoviesDatabase API, you must authenticate your requests using RapidAPI credentials. This involves including specific headers in each HTTP request:

### Required Headers

- `X-RapidAPI-Key`: Your unique API key provided by RapidAPI after subscribing to the MoviesDatabase API.
- `X-RapidAPI-Host`: The host name for the API, which should be set to `moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com`.

### Example

```http
GET https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles/search/title/Inception

## Error Handling

The MoviesDatabase API follows standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Below are common error responses and how to handle them in your application:

### Common Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**  
  The request was malformed or missing required parameters.  
  _Solution_: Double-check the endpoint URL, query parameters, and ensure all required fields are provided.

- **401 Unauthorized**  
  Authentication failed due to a missing or invalid API key.  
  _Solution_: Verify that your `X-RapidAPI-Key` header is present and correct.

- **403 Forbidden**  
  You do not have permission to access the requested resource.  
  _Solution_: Ensure your subscription plan includes access to the endpoint you're trying to use.

- **404 Not Found**  
  The requested resource could not be found.  
  _Solution_: Check that the title ID, actor ID, or search term is valid and correctly formatted.

- **429 Too Many Requests**  
  You have exceeded the rate limit for your plan.  
  _Solution_: Implement request throttling or retry logic with exponential backoff.

- **500 Internal Server Error**  
  An unexpected error occurred on the server.  
  _Solution_: Retry the request after a short delay. If the issue persists, contact RapidAPI support.

### Best Practices

- Always check the HTTP status code before processing the response.
- Use `try/catch` blocks or error-handling middleware in your code to gracefully manage failures.
- Log error messages and response bodies for debugging and monitoring.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

### Usage Limits

The MoviesDatabase API is hosted on RapidAPI, which enforces usage limits based on your subscription tier. These limits typically include:

- **Monthly Request Quota**: The number of requests you can make per month.
- **Rate Limits**: The maximum number of requests allowed per second or minute.
- **Overage Charges**: If you exceed your quota, additional charges may apply depending on your plan.

You can view your current usage and limits in your RapidAPI dashboard.

### Best Practices

- **Cache Responses**: To reduce redundant API calls and stay within rate limits, cache frequently accessed data such as movie details or actor profiles.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement robust error handling to manage rate limit errors (HTTP 429), authentication failures, and server issues.
- **Use Pagination**: When retrieving large datasets (e.g., search results), use pagination to avoid overwhelming the API and improve performance.
- **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check your usage stats on RapidAPI to avoid unexpected overages.
- **Secure Your API Key**: Never expose your API key in public repositories or client-side code. Use environment variables or secure vaults.

Following these practices will help ensure reliable, efficient, and cost-effective integration with the MoviesDatabase API.
